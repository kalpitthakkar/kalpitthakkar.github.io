<div>
"I am a wandering researcher who has little idea about what exactly is he interested in. The intellectual pursuit tantalizes my wits and takes me to places unknown, where I hope to rediscover myself."  
Apart from kidding myself with my writing skills, I am interested in performing research related to learning representations from videos, self-supervised learning methods with a touch of cognitive science / neuroscience evidence and improving interpretability of present neural networks using synthetic tasks.
<br/> <br />
Presently, I am working for <a href="https://leapmind.io/en/">Leapmind</a> as a Machine Learning Engineer. In the past, I have worked as a Research Assistant to <a href="https://vivo.brown.edu/display/tserre">Prof. Thomas Serre</a> at Brown University.
<br /> <br/>
I completed my Bachelors in Computer Science and Engineering, combined with a thesis-based Masters at <a href="https://www.iiit.ac.in/">International Institute of Information Technology, Hyderabad</a> with <a href="https://faculty.iiit.ac.in/~pjn/">Prof. P J Narayanan</a> as my advisor. My Master's <a href="/files/final_thesis.pdf">thesis</a> was based on Human Action Recognition from 3D pose data.
<br />
Besides my academic endeavors, I deeply love and enjoy playing Football (EU) during my free time. Running has been my newfound love for the year of twenty-nineteen and I intend to have a fulfilling relationship with it.
