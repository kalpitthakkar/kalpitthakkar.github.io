When you do not like something or someone, it so happens that the inner voice wants to fight back but you somehow feel afraid of confrontation. Confronting people you need to talk to, confronting your own feelings or confronting your own parents. But saving yourself from confrontation begets fake relationships. Relationships without depth. And before you know it, confrontation will be your only option and it will be painful. Real painful.  
Muster up courage to face circumstances head on. Being rude or judgemental won't help, but being clear about what one could not tolerate is necessary. Ofcourse, nobody knows themselves perfectly so it is not easy to confront. Well, there's one small tip that I would like to share: "Most importantly, make sure what you __*do not*__ want to do is never done. It is easier than knowing what you __*want*__ to do."  
Knowing the difference between what you want and what you need, is the key to a lot of daily decisions and confrontations that one must face. Learn what you __*do not*__ need and make sure that those things are absolutely not tolerated. Start from there.
