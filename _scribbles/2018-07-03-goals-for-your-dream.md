If I ask someone what their goal is and they tell me their goal equals their dream, chances are that that someone won't see the day their dream comes true. Goals -- they lead you to your dream. They need to be set every single day. Goals make your layout and dream is the final built home. You know what they say, "Rome was not built in a day". What they didn't say is that "we never stopped building it, not even a single day". Set your goals day by day and strive to achieve them. A goal a day. Your roadmap to the next goal.  
How do we know that the goals we set everyday will result in accomplishing the dream? We don't. But according to my experience, you won't fail. You will find ten thousand ways that did not work. And guess what? The next one will. And if you know what I'm going to say now, you've understood the spirit of this post: "Do __NOT__ stop at ten thousand".  
Each and every day, and you will find your way. Once on your way, you can accomplish whatever you say.
Keep at it. Because as Charles Bukowski said:
