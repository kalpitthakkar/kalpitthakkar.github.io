title: New beginnings are exciting, but..

Whenever we buy something new, start a new habit, begin a new phase in life, everything is very exciting. It is easy to go through your days, you feel very energized, you dance and listen to amazing songs all the time.
However, the tricky part is continuing the feeling of "new" even after the excitement dies, as it inevitably does after your happy initial days.  
It takes effort and commitment to keep at it. It takes courage to go on even when you are bored, as you know there will be challenges. If only we could see a glimpse of the rainbow on the other side of this "non-exciting" tunnel.
All about incentive, isn't it?  
__Well, it is.__
Anyway, I hope this new beginning's excitement for me dies hard. But then again, human nature!
