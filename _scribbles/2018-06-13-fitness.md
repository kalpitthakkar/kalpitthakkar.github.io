Getting out of bed early, moving a leg and working on your body are tasks of probably the most important full-time job. The body reaches almost a state of transcendence, like feeling liberated from the inevitable doom of laziness.
And I believe transcendence helps one be more aware and empathetic, as one is satisfied with oneself and can understand others better. Fitness makes the body, which is one masterpiece of machinery, work efficiently.  
Just like the other full-time jobs where there are deliverables, goals and deadlines, fitness should also have pictorial tracking, targets and schedules. How serious one takes it will ensure how seriously the evaluations are done.
Same principle: better "product" produces better "revenue". Ofcourse, what the "revenue" means for each individual varies. However, as long as the "revenue" generates enough motivation, thou shalt progress.  
So, why not? Let us strive for fitness.
