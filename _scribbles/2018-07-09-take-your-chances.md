I believe the qualities that make a good researcher are: (1) an inquisitive mind that wants to look for reasons behind why things work or do not work and, (2) the courage to follow an idea and execute it. Being a good researcher and doing good research are two different things though. Doing good research resides at the culmination of several other factors such as good mentorship, constructive environment and the guts to never give up.  
In all realities of life, being good at something and actually doing it good are two very different things because several external factors present challenges when one endeavours to actually doing it good -- doing it justice. And one of the best ways to face the uncertainties in the outcomes of our efforts is to learn to take chances. To develop the courage to play against the odds and tell yourself: "Ofcourse I will win. If I fail, I will still win my respect for self for putting myself on the line and not giving up." Win-win, see?  
So, my advice to myself is to take my chances. Be courageous in the face of uncertainty, so that there is one thing that's certain: "I ain't backing down from the fear of facing myself, because I can handle myself." The only person you ever need to _really_ answer to is yourself. Take your chances. You might surprise yourself.
