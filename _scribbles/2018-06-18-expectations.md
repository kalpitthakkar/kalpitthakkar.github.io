Managing these expectations is one of the most difficult tasks in human relationships. Because when the gap between expectation and reality is too much, everything comes crashing down and the relationship is threatened.  
Weighing the expectations according to likelihood of outcomes is a learned art and comes with experience. It comes easy to a rational human than one who follows the heart over the brain. And well, communicating the expectations effectively is also an essential part of every relationship. In a nutshell, bridging the gap between expectations and reality with experience is significant for any successful and healthy relationship.
