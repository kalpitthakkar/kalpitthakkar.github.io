title: Dream big, start small

Everyone has a dream about what they want to do or who they want to be in life. One should dream big, because it instills direction and drive in life decisions. However, while walking on the path towards achieving that dream, one needs to start small in setting the goals so they remain tractable and effective. You need to learn to take baby steps first if you want to run, and you need to run for 5 km first if you want to complete a marathon. And accomplishing the dream is like running a marathon.  
If you want to become a professor, you need to complete a Bachelors, Masters and a PhD. Most probably a post-doc too. If you want to become a professional sportsperson, you need to learn the game, work on fitness, play small tournaments and work your way up the hierarchy. It is never easy, but starting small keeps things in visual field of view clearly; otherwise, the view gets blurred and focus is lost. One step each day is enough to achieve a life-long dream, as long as you are consistent.
