    <p> I am fascinated as well as scared by the pace at which progress is being made in pushing the
    boundaries of Artificial Intelligence. I want to contribute to the frontiers making this field
    exciting and therefore, I have chosen to work in the area of embedded deep learning as it makes 
    way for very fast, power-efficient and accessible smart devices. As a result, I recently accepted a job
    offer from a Japanese startup <a href="https://leapmind.io">LeapMind Inc.</a> (start: January 6 '20).</p>

    <p>I finished my Master's <a href="/files/final_thesis.pdf">thesis</a> under <a href="https://faculty.iiit.ac.in/~pjn/">Prof. P J Narayanan</a>
    in July 2018 and now the question bothered me: "Is a PhD my clear next step or is that a bad idea?".
    I needed some perspective and time to ponder, so I left for a Research Assistantship at Brown University
    under <a href="https://vivo.brown.edu/display/tserre">Prof. Thomas Serre</a>. The work was related to deep learning on videos and
    I loved understanding videos using DL. After a lot of pondering and working with better researchers, I
    understood why PhD is not for me and I ended up looking for a job, in startups.</p>

    <p> I believe that a lot of my personality has developed while watching the legendary anime series
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naruto"><strong>Naruto</strong></a>, created by
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Masashi_Kishimoto">Masashi Kishimoto</a>. I grew up with it.
    This page about myself, therefore, ends with my favorite conviction from Naruto in that anime series.
    Dattebayo simply means "believe it".</p>
