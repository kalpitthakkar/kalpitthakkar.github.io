# I am Frodo without the One Ring

I am a wandering researcher who has no idea what exactly is he interested in. The intellectual pursuit tantalizes my wits and takes me to places unknown, where I hope to find out that the One Ring is not the ultimate power.

Apart from kidding myself with my writing skills (ha.. ha), I am generally interested in performing research related to discovering dirty tricks to push state-of-the-art of recently published neural networks, learning about visual cortex to incorporate the learnings into deep learning models for computer vision and improving interpretability of present neural networks using synthetic tasks.

Presently, I am working as a Research Assistant under [Prof. Thomas Serre](https://vivo.brown.edu/display/tserre) at Brown University. I completed my Bachelors in Computer Science and Engineering, as well as a thesis-based Masters at [International Institute of Information Technology, Hyderabad](https://www.iiit.ac.in/) with [Prof. P J Narayanan](https://faculty.iiit.ac.in/~pjn/) as my advisor. My research in Masters was based on Human Action Recognition from 3D pose data.

Besides my academic endeavors, I deeply love and enjoy playing Soccer (US) / Football (EU) during my free time. Running has been my newfound love for the year of twenty-nineteen and I intend to have a fulfilling relationship with it.
