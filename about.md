"I am a wandering researcher who has little idea about what exactly is he interested in. The intellectual pursuit tantalizes my wits and takes me to places unknown, where I hope to rediscover myself."  
Apart from kidding myself with my writing skills, I am interested in performing research related to learning representations from videos, self-supervised learning methods with a touch of cognitive science / neuroscience evidence and improving interpretability of present neural networks using synthetic tasks.

Presently, I am working as a Research Assistant to [Prof. Thomas Serre](https://vivo.brown.edu/display/tserre) at Brown University. I completed my Bachelors in Computer Science and Engineering, combined with a thesis-based Master's at [International Institute of Information Technology, Hyderabad](https://www.iiit.ac.in/) with [Prof. P J Narayanan](https://faculty.iiit.ac.in/~pjn/) as my advisor. My Master's [thesis](/assets/files/final_thesis.pdf) was based on Human Action Recognition from 3D pose data.

Besides my academic endeavors, I deeply love and enjoy playing Football (EU) during my free time. Running has been my newfound love for the year of twenty-nineteen and I intend to have a fulfilling relationship with it.
